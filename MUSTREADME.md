We only commit wl files, so that we can all monitor the changes we make. 

To create such a file, go to save as -> Wolfram Language Pack. You can download the wl file and open it as a notebook,
by changing the wl extension to nb. When you're done, make sure to save as wl again and commit. 

We merge after review.
